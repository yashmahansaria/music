# Exploring Chord Progressions.
I have always enjoyed music. Growing up, being a vocalist for my band, this was my way of forgetting everything happening with me and working with my mates on a new song gave me confidence to put my work out there. This forced me to visualise these chrd progressions. 
We can uncover trends in the kinds of chord progressions used by popular artists by analyzing the harmonic data provided in the McGill Billboard Dataset. This dataset includes professionally tagged chords for several hundred pop/rock songs representative of singles that made the Billboard Hot 100 list between 1958 and 1991. Using the data-wrangling tools available in the dplyr package, and the visualization tools available in the ggplot2 package, we can explore the most common chords and chord progressions in these songs, and contrast the harmonies of some guitar-led and piano-led artists to see where the "affordances" of those instruments may affect the chord choices artists make.
